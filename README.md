# 📱 Data Storyteller 🏥

_**THINKING ABOUT SOME QUOTE**_ <br />

## Introduction 

As per Gartner [2], the analytics and business intelligence platform market has transitioned from the visual data discovery era to the augmented era. Data and analytics leaders should begin piloting capabilities that enable the “augmented consumer”.

With the technology advancements, the organisation today has the advantage of taking data driven decisions and create their planning, forecasts based on the same. Many business users do not have time to analyze the data and then get insights. And there are gaps between how the tool produces an output and how the business user can use it to interpret it. In addition, it needs a good domain knowledge to build business insights from data. Not every user is a business expert. Given a snapshot of data, we would like to build a system which can tell a story from the data. The story includes the automation in the sense of being driven by the data, context and personal preferences. In this case, it solves both the problems of the tool usage as well as guiding the user with the data driven intelligence to make business decision. The whole result is driven by outcome and effectiveness.

## Tool Description 

Data Storyteller is an AI based tool that can take a data set, identify patterns in the data, can interpret the result, and can then produce an output story that is understandable to a business user based on the context. It is able to pro-actively analyse data on behalf of users and generate smart feeds using natural language generation techniques which can then be consumed easily by business users with very less efforts. The application has been built keeping in mind a rather elementary user and is hence, easily usable and understandable.

## Features 

Given data/analytics output, the tool can:-

- turn the data into interactive data stories based on the given data 
- generate deep insights, infer pattern and help in business decisions.
- provide personalization profiles; these could be represented as meta data describing what would be of interest to a given user.
- generate reports understandable to a business user with interactive and intuitive interface.

## 📝 Module-Wise Description

The application also uses Streamlit for a multiclass page implementation which can be viewed in the `multipage.py` file.
